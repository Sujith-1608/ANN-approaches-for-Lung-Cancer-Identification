# ANN-approaches-for-Lung-Cancer-Identification ü´Å

This project focuses on automated lung cancer detection using CT scan images. Leveraging image processing techniques and an artificial neural network (ANN), it performs pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. Machine learning models like SVM, K- Means, KNN, and CNN were tested, with CNN achieving the highest accuracy. The system aims to enhance diagnosis accuracy and reduce human error in early lung cancer detection.

## Project Overview üìù

Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates. This project leverages image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to identify potential lung cancer cases.

The project integrates:
- **K-Means clustering**: For segmentation and preprocessing of lung images.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: For classification of cancerous vs. non-cancerous cases.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

The following technologies and libraries were used in this project:

- **Python**: Programming language
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **OpenCV**: Image processing

## Dataset üìÇ

The dataset contains lung CT scan images labeled as cancerous or non-cancerous. The preprocessing pipeline ensures images are appropriately segmented and ready for classification.

**Note**: Due to privacy concerns, the dataset is not included in this repository. You can use publicly available datasets such as [LIDC-IDRI](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/LIDC-IDRI) or your own custom data.

## Installation üíª

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sujith-1608/ANN-approaches-for-Lung-Cancer-Identification.git
   cd ANN-approaches-for-Lung-Cancer-Identification
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure that you have the dataset ready in the expected folder structure or modify the script to point to your dataset.

## Usage üöÄ

To run the project, execute the following steps:

1. Preprocess the dataset:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

4. Visualize results:
   ```bash
   python visualize_results.py
   ```

Detailed explanations of each script can be found in their respective files.

## Results üìä

The model achieves an accuracy of **X%** (replace with actual result after training). Detailed metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are provided in the results section. Visualization of correctly and incorrectly classified cases is also included.
