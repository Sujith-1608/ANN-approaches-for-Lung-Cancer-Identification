# ANN-approaches-for-Lung-Cancer-Identification

This project focuses on automated lung cancer detection using CT scan images. Leveraging image processing techniques and an artificial neural network (ANN), it performs pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. Machine learning models like SVM, K- Means, KNN, and CNN were tested, with CNN achieving the highest accuracy. The system aims to enhance diagnosis accuracy and reduce human error in early lung cancer detection.
