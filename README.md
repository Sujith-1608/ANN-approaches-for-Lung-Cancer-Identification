# ANN-approaches-for-Lung-Cancer-Identification

Lung cancer detection is vital for improving survival rates. Our project automates this process using CT scans and machine learning models like SVM, KNN, K-Means, and CNN, with CNN providing the highest accuracy. This approach reduces human error and enhances diagnostic efficiency.
